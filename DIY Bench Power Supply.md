# DIY Bench Power Supply

We use a power supply from an old desktop for our 3.3, 5 and 12V source when running proof of concept stuff. Its pretty agricultural and one of the non-engineers blew a sensor when it was hooked to the wrong voltage. Easy done as its just assumed knowledge as to which cable is which voltage.

I am going to build this straight from [DroneBot]'s website. All kudos to him.

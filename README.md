> A personal collection of stuff. Written with :heart: in Vim using `Vimwiki`

### What

A personal repo of things I have found important along the way, think I might need later, found interesting, or want to keep for referencing. I also use `Vimwiki`'s diary mode for logging daily work and non-work tasks - I have elected to keep that off this repo for security reasons.

### Why

I have entertained many markdown note taking apps such as:

- [Boostnote](boostnote.io), 
- [Turtl](turtlapp.com) (its still pretty rad, worth a look),
- Atom,
- VSCode, and
- Sublime Text.

They all have their place but I just haven't taken to any of them for pure note taking. 

Mostly because I spent too much time trying to make them work like vim. I've now settled for [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), and this repo is representative of that.

I also want to make these things public so I can access them when away from my systems, and on a platform that is unlikely to fade in the near future.

### How

`Vimwiki` provides a simple interface and all the Vim trimmings. I have set a few custom functions to make it conform to my own workflow.

If I ever need to pull this down to a new system, simply install `vimwiki` using `vim-plug` and then clone this into `~/vimwiki`. That is `vimwiki`'s default home location but can be changed if required.

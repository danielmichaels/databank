### Why

I have entertained many markdown note taking apps such as:

- [Boostnote](boostnote.io), 
- [Turtl](turtlapp.com) (its still pretty rad, worth a look),
- Atom,
- VSCode, and
- Sublime Text.

They all have their place but I just haven't taken to any of them for pure note taking. 

Mostly because I spent too much time trying to make them work like vim. I've now settled for [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), and this repo is representative of that.

# The Slight Edge

> Do the thing, and you shall have the power.

- You have complete control over the direction that the rest of your life takes.
- "This is Football" or why we overcomplicate everything.

## Beginning 

* Two Mindsets:
  * Entitled: "What have you done for *me* lately", "Pay me more and I'll work harder"
  * Value-driven: "What can *I* do to help you?", "I'll work harder, and then I expect you'll pay me more"

* The Water Hyacinth:
  * A story of the plant that doubles itself each day - starting at a single cell.
  * It takes many days of seemingly no growth before it compounds monumentally to eventually over grow the entire lily pond
  * This story demonstrates that the little changes compounded over time aren't noticed, they are so slight that its not noticed for a long period. When it is noticed the onlookers think "it happened overnight" which it surely did not!

* The Millionaires Sons:
  * Another story, this time about two boys each given a choice; receive 1 million dollars 30 days after their fathers death, or get 1 penny but have its value double everyday for 30 days.
  * 1 penny compounded each day for 30 days is 10 million dollars...

> "It's never too late to start" & "It's always too late to wait"

- Parkinson's Law states:
  - "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

* Spare a thought for what junk you put in your body:
  * It's not a trash can
  * "Many of us are literally digging our graves with our teeth."

> Consistently repeated daily actions + time = unconquerable results

## Happiness 

Happiness is more important to our success than we realise. These are some "happy habits":

1. Each morning, write down three things you are grateful for:
  * Not the same three; new ones that force you to think of new tings to be grateful for.
2. Journal for two minutes each day about something positive:
  * Write down this positive moment in great detail - this causes the brain to relive that happy experience, doubling the positive impact. I also find it gives me time to reflect, and think back on my day often seeing many moments worth writing about.
3. Mediate daily
  * Just stop and do nothing for two minutes. Breathe in and out letting it all wash over you. Relax your body from bottom to top through visualisations such as "making your legs concrete and heavy".
4. Do one random act of kindness each day
  * Praise someone, or thank them when it is not expected. Offer time, or assistance when no one expects it. 
5. Exercise for 15 minutes daily
  * Simple cardio; a brisk walk, or hardcore session, its this stimulation for the body that triggers a strong antidepressant response. 15 minutes is 1% of your day; you have the time!
6. Read at least **ten** pages of a good book each day!

This list is only 30 minutes of each day but the key is not to over commit and start doing it all. Begin slowly, developing that slight edge by creating lifelong habits. Once you habitualise one, add another. This is a lifelong journey.

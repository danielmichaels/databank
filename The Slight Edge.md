# The Slight Edge

> Do the thing, and you shall have the power.

- You have complete control over the direction that the rest of your life takes.
- "This is Football" or why we overcomplicate everything.

* Two Mindsets:
  * Entitled: "What have you done for *me* lately", "Pay me more and I'll work harder"
  * Value-driven: "What can *I* do to help you?", "I'll work harder, and then I expect you'll pay me more"

* The Water Hyacinth:
  * A story of the plant that doubles itself each day - starting at a single cell.
  * It takes many days of seemingly no growth before it compounds monumentally to eventually over grow the entire lily pond
  * This story demonstrates that the little changes compounded over time aren't noticed, they are so slight that its not noticed for a long period. When it is noticed the onlookers think "it happened overnight" which it surely did not!

* The Millionaires Sons:
  * Another story, this time about two boys each given a choice; receive 1 million dollars 30 days after their fathers death, or get 1 penny but have its value double everyday for 30 days.
  * 1 penny compounded each day for 30 days is 10 million dollars...

> "It's never too late to start" & "It's always too late to wait"

- Parkinson's Law states:
  - "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."

* Spare a thought for what junk you put in your body:
  * It's not a trash can
  * "Many of us are literally digging our graves with our teeth."

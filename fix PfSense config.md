# PfSense

Current configuration is getting bloated. The backup config has data from several versions ago.
This may cause issues with the 2.5.x update which is due to drop shortly.

## TODO

- [ ] DNS forward only through pfSense
- [ ] VPN network
- [ ] WAN network
- [ ] Static IP's for Netflix/Stan hosts
- [ ] VLAN segments -> mgmt, vpn, clear, lab, camera

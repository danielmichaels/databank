# Do The Work notes

You will spend your life fighting an invisible protean force that will do anything to stop you from doing the work.

That force is called the resistance and it takes many forms, and it will never stop.

Any endeavour requiring artisitc flair, technical prowess, phyiscal, mental or emotional sacrifice, will be at the mercy of the resistance

When you feel the urge to quit something you desire to do because of reasons unknown, that is when you must keep going.

- Start at the end
- Have a theme; what is this project about?
- Break it into acts:
  - ACT 1: Beginning
  - ACT 2: Middle
  - ACT 3: End
- Research is a form of resistance
- Conduct a weekly meeting with yourself and ask:
  - What is this project about
  - What is the theme
  - Am I staying true to the theme
- Resistance is the Dragon; once you slay it, you'll always know its fallible although you will still continue to fight it.
- The price of "shipping" your project/task/whatever is discomfort:
  - Remember, you are fighting in the Arena; you're gonna take some blows
  - But, that is the price of being one of the elite few to ever finish something meaningful and represent yourself on the public stage
  - "Only the elite, ship"

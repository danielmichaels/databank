> Questions on how to make something better requires you to INVERT the question - focus on what could make it worse and avoid those things

> Complexity is not a sign of intelligence; simplify.

__on the bankers, and the banking system:__
> ..they privatise the gains and socialise the losses

__Jerry Seinfield on 'quality time':__
> Spending quality time with your kids is nonsense. It the times when you were eating cereal together late at night or laying about on the couch that are actually some of the best moments.

> “It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.” — Nathaniel Borenstein, 1992

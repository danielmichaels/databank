# Playbook

> A personal collection of stuff. Written with :heart: in Vim using `Vimwiki`

### What

A personal repo of things I have found important along the way, think I might need later, found interesting, or want to keep for referencing.

### Why

I have entertained many markdown note taking apps but none offered the simplicity of vim.

Too much time has been wasted trying to make them work like vim. Enter [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki),

I also want to make these things public so I can access them when away from my systems, and on a platform that is unlikely to fade in the near future.

### How

`Vimwiki` provides a simple interface and all the Vim trimmings. I have set a few custom functions to make it conform to my own workflow.

If I ever need to pull this down to a new system, simply install `vimwiki` using `vim-plug` and then clone this into the `databank/playbook` repo. The custom location, as well as markdown support must be set inside `vimrc`.

Custom keymappings are located in my `.vimrc`.

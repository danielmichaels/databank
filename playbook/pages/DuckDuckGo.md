# DuckDuckGo

A versatile and functional replacement for Google. Here is a list of awesome features.

## Bangs

`!g search-term` will send the query to `google.com/search-term`

## Answers

A random list of useful things you can search.

- `html chars` will output all html encoded characters
- `shorten https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/android-browser-security-hole-affects-millions-of-users-says-expert-592578` will shorten to 'https://is.gd/qny9I9'
- `expand https://is.gd/LEwkFT` will expand to the URL above.

## User Search

Search for social media user bio's with the `@` symbol. 

`@extrapancakes_` in the search bar will find my Twitter handle.

## Figlet

This gets a special mention because I use this on my open source CLI's often enough to warrant this getting a mention.

`figlet httptracer` will output:

```sh
 _     _   _         _                           
| |__ | |_| |_ _ __ | |_ _ __ __ _  ___ ___ _ __

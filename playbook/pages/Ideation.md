# Ideation

A Massive dump of ideas - mostly terrible. This is about exercising my creativity 
and thoughts, rather than developing the next Facebook!

Old List: 

- [Project Ideas](Project-Ideas)

New List:

- shoe horn repairer
- colouriser for websites aka drop-in light/dark
- map popup widget for websites
- password manager for secure environments (better than D42)
- podcast transcript parser - users can easily highlight/ condense for rapid learning
- OSINT tool to strip data from a given set of id's such as usernames/emails etc
- pharmaceutical arbitrage | buy cheap from one country/region sell high somewhere else
- shopify stores for niches like fasteners industry
- an easier way to pass off information between handsets & browsers, I am sick of using whatsapp or something to send my self links
- IG android emulator `docker-compose up -d` and a session launches ready to login with IG - better for social network marketers
- visual docker inspector - `docker image ls` sucks | layer inspector would be nice too
- "leave now" reminder service
- hackers for hire service
- what's stream is that? Netflix, disney, stan, amazon; srsly which one has that show I want...

- MITM software for scraper of phones/tablets/IOT devices in an easier to setup manner
- Better API detection for mobile endpoints
- parking inspector spoofing | print lifelike tickets to fool inspectors
- Facebook better account management for small businesses | control in a better web app and it uses selenium etc to do the hard parts FB UI sucks
- Angler app with better tidal, wind, fish biting characteristics using highly local and short term forecasts (next 60 minutes) rather than 3 days out
- eSIM company - what does that look like | they are the future of handsets once we fully cut over to packet switching
- OSINT for small business intelligence; what's my competitiors doing. put in their name|social etc and automate a daily report

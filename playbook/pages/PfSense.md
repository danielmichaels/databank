> Collection of pfSense related info and snippets

pfSense uses stateful packet filtering, based on the pf BSD application.

## Stateful Filtering

Stateful filtering tracks the origin of incoming requests in a state table, allowing the firewall to reply to the originating host without outbound rules being applied. The filtering application maintains a table that tracks the origin and destination port numbers and IP addresses.

# Simple secure storage (S3)

## TL;DR

- Secure, durable and highly scalable object storage
- Simple UI to access and retrieve data
- Data is spread across multiple locations (by default)
- zero bytes -> 5TB in capacity
- 'Unlimited storage'
- "buckets" refer to S3 storage
- each S3 bucket is given a globally unique namespace - by default hosted on AWS name servers:
  - `bucket-name-better-be-unique.s3.amazonaws.com/my-stuff`
  - subdomain `bucket-name-better-be-unique` must be unique as its within the `.s3` domain.
- Objects have lifecycle management such as:
  - versioning
  - encryption
  - MFA delete
  - Access control lists and Bucket policies can (and should) be applied

### Data Consistency

- Read after write for PUTS
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (takes some time to propagate the change - due to versioning)
- S3 guarantee's 99.9% availability (built for 99.99%)
- 99.999999999% (11 9's) for durability (prevention of lost data)

### Storage Classes

1. S3 Standard:
    1. 99.99% availability
    2. 11 9's of durability
    3. redundant storage:
        1.  multiple locations, multiple devices, sustained loss of two data facilities concurrently
2. S3-IA (Infrequent Access):
    1. Access required less frequently
    2. Still rapidly accessible
    3. Lower fee structure than S3 Standard, changed a "retrieval fee"
3. S3 One Zone IA:
    1. Lower cost than IA
    2. Only one zone meaning less durability (95%)
4. S3 Intelligent Tiering:
    1. Uses machine learning to intelligently categorise objects into most cost efficient tiering
    2. Will move objects between each tier automatically
5. S3 Glacier:
    1. Low-cost solution for data archiving
    2. Competitive prices compared to on-prem solutions
    3. Retrieval is longer; between 15 minutes to hours
6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
    1. Lowest cost
    2. Retrieval ~ 12 hours or more
    3. Suitable for objects that rarely need access, and when needed are not timely e.g. tax audit information

### S3 Billing

Billing is in accordance with several metrics:
- amount of storage
- number of requests for objects
- tiering model selected
- data transfer pricing (more later)
- transfer acceleration (topic covered next)
- cross region replication requests (each time costs money)

### S3 Transfer Acceleration

- Fast, easy and secure solution for transfering files over long distances
- Instead of users in one region accessing a bucket from another region and utilizing the normal internet infrastructure, Tx Acceleration allows users access to AWS optimized links:
  - Each region has Edge Locations and AWS has optimised links running between these nodes
  - A user in South Africa might need to access a bucket in Canada, using transfer acceleration might be a faster option than using the normal internet
  - Users can check the link speed [here](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html)

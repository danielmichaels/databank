# Thoughts

A collection of interesting thoughts 

__Asked a question you don't know the answer to:__
> I don't know, but if I were to think about it logically, this is how I would approach the problem..

> Questions on how to make something better requires you to INVERT the question - focus on what could make it worse and avoid those things

> Complexity is not a sign of intelligence; simplify.

__on the bankers, and the banking system:__
> ..they privatise the gains and socialise the losses

__Jerry Seinfield on 'quality time':__
> Spending quality time with your kids is nonsense. It the times when you were eating cereal together late at night or laying about on the couch that are actually some of the best moments.

> “It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.” — Nathaniel Borenstein, 1992

> "Today's pleasures beckon stronger than tomorrows pain"
__On Learning goals__:

I will measure my success by having read <N> articles about <Vulnerability Class>, having played around with <Vulnerability Class> in a CTF, shared <N> articles about <Vulnerability Class> with others, and having reported a <Vulnerability Class> ONCE in a VDP or BBP

> Most of time, the biggest obstacle of building & shipping things is over thinking. What if this, what if that. Boy, you are not important at all. Everyone is busy in their own life. No one cares about you and the things you build, until you prove that you are worth other people’s attention. Even you screw up the initial product launch, few people will notice. Think big, start small, act fast. It’s absolutely okay to use the boring technology and start something simple (even ugly), as long as you actually solve problems.

# TODO: Amortization
"""
It is common for loans to be amortized which allows the lendor to collect their interest early in the loan period. We will ignore amortization
for the purpose of this program. For bonus points, figure out how to do amortization and print an amortization schedule with the payment schedule.
There is an excellent explanation of the amortization formula at Interest.com.

Amortization forumla:

A = p(1 + r)n / (1 + r)n - 1

A = amount per period
p = initial principal
r = interest rate
n = number of payments or periods

Write a program that calculates the interest due on a loan and prints a payment schedule. Make sure you round the output to two decimal places.
For bonus points, figure out how to calculate amortization and print an amortization schedule.
It will be your responsibility to find an appropriate format for the amortization printout.
